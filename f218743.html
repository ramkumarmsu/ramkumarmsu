        <LI> <P> Disability Resource Center </P>
<P> Mississippi State University is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all students. The Disability Resource Center (01 Montgomery Hall) collaborates with students who have disabilities to arrange reasonable accommodations. If you have, or think you may have, a disability, please contact drc@saffairs.msstate.edu or 662-325-3335 to arrange a confidential discussion regarding equitable access and reasonable accommodations. Disabilities may include, but are not limited to, conditions related to mental health, chronic health, attention, learning, autism, brain injury, vision, hearing, mobility, speech, or intellectual disabilities. In the case of short-term disabilities (e.g., broken arm), students and instructors can often work to minimize barriers. If additional assistance is needed, please contact the Disability Resource Center. 
</P>
<LI> <P> Continuity of Instruction</P>
<P> In the event that face-to-face classes are suspended due to extenuating circumstances, such as weather, the instructor will continue instruction in a manner that best supports the course content and student engagement. In this event, all instructors will notify students of the change via their university email address (the official vehicle for communication with students). At that time, they will provide details about how instruction and communication will continue, how academic integrity will be ensured, and what students may expect during the time that face-to-face classes are suspended. If a student becomes unable to continue class participation due to extenuating circumstances, (e.g., health and safety, loss of power, etc.)  the student should contact their instructor and advisor for guidance. For additional guidance, please refer to Academic Operating Policy 12.09.
</P>
<LI><P> Attendance policy for face-to-face instruction </P>
