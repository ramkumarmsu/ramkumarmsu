<h3><a name=announcements>Announcements
</h3>
<p>
<b>Announcing "passing of the torch":</b>
On 10/1/14, Dr. M. Ramkumar assumed responsibility for this thesis template, due to Dr. Edward Allen's retirement in May 2015.
Also, examplethesis.pdf was updated for clarity.
</p><p>
<b>Announcing revised approval page layout:</b>
On 8/15/13, we released a new version of msuthesis.cls and examplethesis.tex to conform to a new approval page layout required by the University.
<a href="http://library.msstate.edu/thesis/index.asp">
http://library.msstate.edu/thesis/index.asp
</a>
</p><p>
<b>Announcing a simplification:</b> On 7/11/13, we released a new version of msuthesis.cls and relevant sections of examplethesis.pdf.
The standard LaTeX commands <b>\section</b>, <b>\subsection</b>,  and <b>\subsubsection</b>,
with lower case 's' will now properly indent the first paragraph after a section title when there is a paragraph following the section title.
This indent is required by the <em>Standards</em>.
Similar commands with capital letters ("camel-case") are deprecated,
and therefore should no longer be used with this template.
They will work, but
<b>\Section</b>,
<b>\SubSection</b>,
and <b>\SubSubSection</b> are <b>not</b> recommended.
</p><p>
Similarly, If there is no paragraph
following a section title,
because a subsection title immediately follows,
use the appropriate <b>new</b> command so that the spacing between titles
conforms to the <em>Standards</em>.
Note there are no capital letters in the command names:
<b>\sectionnoparagraph</b>,
<b>\subsectionnoparagraph</b>,
and <b>\subsubsectionnoparagraph</b>.
Similar commands with capital letters ("camel-case") are deprecated,
and therefore should no longer be used with this template.
They will work, but are <b>not</b> recommended, for example,
<b>\SectionNoParagraph</b>.
</p><p>
The new file is at the link below.
</p>

</p><p>
<b>Announcing a bug fix:</b> On 10/19/12, we released a new version of msuthesis.cls that fixes the following bugs that may cause your thesis to be rejected by the library per the 6th edition of the university's <it>Standard</it>.
</p><p>
The new file is at the link below.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The spacing between the title List of Tables and the first entry should be 2 or 3 blank lines. (Previously was just one blank line.)
</li><li>
The spacing between the title List of Figures and the first entry should be 2 or 3 blank lines. (Previously was just one blank line.)
</li><li>
The spacing between a chapter title and the first line of the chapter should be 2 or 3 blank lines.  Previously, if the first line was a paragraph, the spacing was correct, but if the first line was a section title, the spacing was only one blank line.  The correction has 3 blank lines if the first line is a paragraph and 2 blank lines if the first line is a section title.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Announcing a major update:</b>
In May 2012, we released a new version of LaTeX templates for Mississippi State University documents, as described below.  New features include the following.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Conformance with the 2012 6th Edition of <i>Standards for Preparing Theses and Dissertations</i> published by the Graduate School of Mississippi State University. See
<a href="http://www.grad.msstate.edu/current/publications/">http://www.grad.msstate.edu/current/publications/</a>
and <a href="http://library.msstate.edu/thesis">http://library.msstate.edu/thesis</a>
</li><li>
The Dean of the Graduate School has approved automatic placement of figures and tables by LaTeX, even though this style does not always conform to the <i>Standards</i>.  Therefore, you should let the MSU library know that you have used the template when you submit your thesis or dissertation for review.
</li><li>
Choice of graphics file formats used in figures. We provide a batch file for each option for use with TeXworks.  The template supports either of the following but not both in the same document.
   <ul>
   <li>
   *.pdf, *.jpg, and *.png in the same document
   </li><li>
   *.eps only
   </li>
   </ul>
</li><li>
Section titles that are more than one line long.  However, as a matter of style, we discourage long section titles.
</li><li>
Captions of figures and tables that are more than one line long.  However, the template does not support explanatory paragraphs as part of the caption, even though allowed by the <i>Standards</i> and even though that is the style of some journals.
</li><li>
Instructions for using TeXworks which is included with MiKTeX.
</li><li>
A major revision to the example thesis.  See the chapters Getting Started, Preparing References, and Typesetting Figures and Tables.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The prior version was released in June 2009.
</p>

<h3><a name=introduction>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The template presented below was designed for the needs of students in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Mississippi State University.  Others are welcome to use it and to adapt it to your own needs.
</p><p>
LaTeX is an open-source (free) software
system for typesetting documents which extends TeX, a typesetting system
invented by D. E. Knuth. It produces beautiful mathematics and has good
tools for managing bibliographies.&nbsp; However, it does not have a WYSIWYG
user interface.
</p><p>A template for dissertations, theses, and project reports is available for free download.
See the sections below for details. You may download the documents listed below that explain some additional details.
</p><p>
Files for the template are available for free download in a *.zip archive file.  See below.
</p><p>
The files below and the instructions were tested using MS Windows.  The *.zip files were created using MS Windows features.  LaTeX is widely used on other operating systems and porting this template to non-Windows environments should be straight forward.
</p><p>
Please send bug reports to Dr. M. Ramkumar via email at
ramkumar@cse.msstate.edu
</p>


<h3><a name=thesis>
Dissertations, theses, and project reports
</a></h3>
<p>
If you use this template for your thesis or dissertation,
be sure to inform the MSU library staff of this fact
when you submit your document for their review.
This will facilitate their review.
</p><p>
<a href="examplethesis.pdf">examplethesis.pdf</a>
explains how to typeset
a dissertation or thesis using LaTeX that conforms to Mississippi State University standards
and style requirements of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. This example thesis is useful as a template.  The Department of Computer Science and Engineering requires that M.S. Project Reports conform to the same format and style requirements as a thesis.
</p><p>
To use as a template, download the *.zip file into your directory,
unzip using MS Windows features,
and proceed to use it as described in the *.pdf document.

<h3><a name=moreabout>
More about LaTeX
</a></h3>
<p>
Learning LaTeX is similar to learning a programming language like HTML.&nbsp; You
<span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> have a reference manual.&nbsp; I recommend that you <b>buy</b> one
of the following. It will be worth the investment.
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>A Guide to LaTeX</i>, by Helmut Kopka and Patrick W. Daly, Addison-Wesley. This is highly recommended.
</li><li>
<i>The LaTeX Companion</i>, by Michel Goossens, Frank Mittelbach, and Alexander
Samarin, Addison-Wesley.
