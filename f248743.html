<h2> Overview </h2>
This course will explore important infrastructure components of the Internet, their vulnerabilities, and strategies to mitigate vulnerabilities. In particular, cryptographic strategies for securing the Internet infrastructure will be explored. 

<h2> Topics </h2>

The course will begin with an overview of critical (Internet related)  infrastructure, and a broad description of why they exist, and how they function. This will be followed by student presentations. 

Two core infrastructures for the functioning of the Internet are 1) Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and 2) the Domain Name System (DNS). Often, many systems that support this infrastructure are also seen as core infrastructural components. Some examples include
<ol>
<li> Root Servers, 
<li> Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)
<li> Submarine Cable Systems, 
<li> Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), 
<li>Certificate Authorities (CAs) and PKI, 
<li>Time Synchronization Infrastructure (NTP), 
<li>IANA and Regional Internet Registries (RIRs),
<li>Inter-AS routing systems, etc. 
</ol> 
Students are required to structure their presentations around such core components.  Due to the extensive scope of topics,  specific topics that will be addressed in this course will depend on topics chosen by students.  Some additional suggested topics (in no particular order) for student presentations are
<ol>
<li>Dyn DDoS Attack (2016),
<li>DNSpionage Campaign (2018-2019),
<li>Sea Turtle Campaign (2019),
<li>YouTube Pakistan Incident (2008),
<li>China Telecom BGP Hijack (2010),
<li>Amazon Route 53 BGP Hijack (2018),
<li>Google BGP Mishap (2018),
<li>Facebook Global Outage (2021),
<li>October 2002 DDoS Attack,
<li>February 2007 DDoS Attack,
<li>November-December 2015 Reflection/Amplification Attack,
<li>2016 Mirai Botnet Attacks,
<li>Anycast,
<li>PKI and RPKI,
<li>BGPSec,
<li>DNSSEC
</ol>
Students are expected to identify and suggest at least 3 suitable  technical papers / articles for their presentation (in the order of preference) by September 7. This will be used to begin scheduling of student presentations and discussions for the remainder of the course.


Presentation schedule will be posted in canvas as soon as the schedule is finalized. As schedule may change due to various reasons, students are expected to check Canvas announcements regularly.

The course will  will start with 2-3  introductory lectures from the instructor.

        <LI> <P> Disability Resource Center </P>
<P> Mississippi State University is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all students. The Disability Resource Center (01 Montgomery Hall) collaborates with students who have disabilities to arrange reasonable accommodations. If you have, or think you may have, a disability, please contact drc@saffairs.msstate.edu or 662-325-3335 to arrange a confidential discussion regarding equitable access and reasonable accommodations. Disabilities may include, but are not limited to, conditions related to mental health, chronic health, attention, learning, autism, brain injury, vision, hearing, mobility, speech, or intellectual disabilities. In the case of short-term disabilities (e.g., broken arm), students and instructors can often work to minimize barriers. If additional assistance is needed, please contact the Disability Resource Center. 
</P>
<LI> <P> Continuity of Instruction</P>
<P> In the event that face-to-face classes are suspended due to extenuating circumstances, such as weather, the instructor will continue instruction in a manner that best supports the course content and student engagement. In this event, all instructors will notify students of the change via their university email address (the official vehicle for communication with students). At that time, they will provide details about how instruction and communication will continue, how academic integrity will be ensured, and what students may expect during the time that face-to-face classes are suspended. If a student becomes unable to continue class participation due to extenuating circumstances, (e.g., health and safety, loss of power, etc.)  the student should contact their instructor and advisor for guidance. For additional guidance, please refer to Academic Operating Policy 12.09.
</P>
<LI><P> Attendance policy for face-to-face instruction </P>
